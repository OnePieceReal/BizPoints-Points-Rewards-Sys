According to Figure 1, the UML Use Case Diagram has a client and a user that are able to use the Loyalty Points & Rewards System. The client is able to earn points, redeem points, and view points balance. Earning points include purchases, subscriptions, and events participation; having the ability to gain bonus points by attending webinars, and engaging with customer support. Redeeming points allows the client to obtain a service discount, gain access to exclusive business tools, and other premium features of BizPoints. 

The administrator can use the Loyalty Points & Rewards System to manage users by adding new users, manage points by adding new transactions, and viewing a client’s points balance.
