# AlphaBiz Loyalty Program Web Portal

A web-based Loyalty Program Portal developed as part of the CPS714 course, designed to reward AlphaBiz clients for engaging with the company's products and services.

## 🧾 Project Overview

This project simulates a loyalty program for a mock company, **AlphaBiz**. The portal enables clients to earn and redeem points based on various activities such as:

- Product purchases  
- Software subscriptions  
- Participation in business development events  

Clients can redeem these points for:

- Service discounts  
- Premium features  
- Exclusive business resources  

The portal includes:

- **Client-facing system** – Users can track their points and redeem rewards.  
- **Administrative backend** – AlphaBiz can manage rewards, monitor client engagement, and evaluate program performance.

The platform is modular, divided into **eight sub-projects**, each targeting specific functionalities for a complete and scalable system.
